# 📊 Telecom Customer & Revenue Analysis 

## 📌  Project Overview
This project is a MySQL-based SQL portfolio showcasing real-world business analysis queries across customer behavior, revenue, churn, and product performance.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to extract meaningful insights from relational databases and support data-driven decision-making.
The queries are designed at an intermediate to advanced level, reflecting scenarios commonly faced by data analysts in telecom, e-commerce, or subscription-based businesses.

  - Customers – customer profile, age, location, activation date
  - Orders – order details, order date, quantities
  - Products – product details, pricing, and data plan
  - customers_usage – usage_id, customer_id, month, data_used_gb, call_minutes
